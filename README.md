# missing-child-identification-system
the System is a machine learning–based application designed to help identify missing children from images. The system allows authorized users to upload a child’s photo, and the model compares it with images stored in the database to find possible matches.  It uses  ML classification techniques to assist in quick and efficient identification.

Features

Image Upload Module – Upload a child’s photo for identification.

ML-Based Matching – Extracts facial features and compares with stored images.

Efficient Search – Quickly returns similar or possible match results.

User-Friendly Interface – Simple UI for easy use by authorized personnel.

Secure Data Handling – Ensures safe storage and restricted access.

Database Management – Stores child records, photos, and match history.


🚀 How It Works

User uploads an image of the child.

System processes the image (feature extraction).
